# STM32 Bare-Metal Programming 🚀  

This repository contains my learning journey through the **Embedded Systems Bare-Metal Programming Ground Up™ (STM32)** course. The focus is on writing firmware **from scratch** using **bare-metal embedded C** and **register manipulations**—without relying on third-party libraries like HAL, LL, or StdPeriph.  

## 🔥 What This Repository Covers  

- 📖 **Understanding the STM32 Reference Manual & Datasheet**  
- 🔍 **Defining Peripheral Addresses & Registers**  
- 🏗️ **Building Bare-Metal Drivers for Peripherals**  
  - GPIO (General Purpose I/O)  
  - ADC (Analog-to-Digital Converter)  
  - SPI (Serial Peripheral Interface)  
  - I2C (Inter-Integrated Circuit)  
  - UART (Universal Asynchronous Receiver-Transmitter)  
  - Timers (PWM, SysTick, General Purpose)  
  - DMA (Direct Memory Access)  
  - NVIC (Nested Vector Interrupt Controller)  
- 🛠️ **Debugging & Understanding CMSIS**  

## 💻 Development Setup  

- **Microcontroller:** STM32F4-NUCLEO (ARM Cortex-M4)  
- **IDE:** STM32CubeIDE (Free)  
- **Debugger:** OpenOCD / GDB  
- **Language:** C (Bare-Metal)
